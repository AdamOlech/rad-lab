# Scripts

The scripts folder contains a number of tools that are used by the RAD Lab modules to automate a number of tasks, of which the installer is the most notable one.

## Installer

`radlab.py` is the installer that can be used to automate the installation of the modules.  [Here](INSTALLER.md) you can read more about how to use it.

Run `python3 radlab.py` in this directory to start the wizard to create a module.
